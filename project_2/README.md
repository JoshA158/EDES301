## Project 02: PCB Design for an Etch-a-Sketch

This github repository is dedicated to my second EDES301 project. In this project I used the Eagle software to design and build a custom-made pcb for a simple Etch-A-Sketch device. Here you will find the files for my PCB's schematics, board layout, component library, gerber files, BOM, and all relevant images. As a result, this repository should contain all thr files needed to have the pcb manufactured by companies such as JLCPCB or MacroFab.com

Thank you to my instructor Erik Welsh for providing a system block diagram to follow and for teaching my how to effectively use the Eagle software.
